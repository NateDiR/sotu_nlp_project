*"He shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."*

— Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution

In this project, we'll analyze [State of the Union Addresses from 1790-2022](https://www.kaggle.com/jyronw/us-state-of-the-union-addresses-1790-2019), courtesy of Kaggle.com.

The goal will be to identify the main topics of each speech, and see if they align with legislative items Congress took up in ensuing year.

To accomplish this, we will use NLP libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **gensim**, **SpaCy**, and **NLTK**. We will also make use of **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation, and **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Tableau** for visualization.

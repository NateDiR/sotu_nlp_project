#### Statement of Need:

*"He shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."*

— Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution Constitution

In American politics, the State of the Union address plays a unique role. It has traditionally been used by Presidents to prioritize *'such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient'* to the Congress. But in modern times, it is often used as means of highlighting the accomplishments of an administration, as well as signalling what the legislative priorities of a President might be in the upcoming year. In this project, we will analyze presidents' State of the Union addresses from George Washington in 1790 to Joe Biden in 2022. The goal will be to identify the main topics of each address, and explore whether meaningful legislative action was subsequently taken on those topics. Our hypthetical audience for this project would be any organization with a vested interest in understanding Congressional priorites-- investors, lobbyists, trade associations and unions, etc.

#### Data Description:
- The Data for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jyronw/us-state-of-the-union-addresses-1790-2019), with the most recent SOTU address by President Biden being added manually.
- In this dataset, an individual obersvation includes President name, year, title (e.g. First/Eighth State of the Union), and the entire text of the State of the Union address delivered in that year, by that President.

#### Tools:
- **scikit-learn**, **gensim**, **SpaCy**, and **NLTK** for text processing.
- **Pandas**, and **NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Tableau** for visualization.

#### MVP Goal:
* Basic output showing topics for each State of the Union speech.
